# AntiGoogle

AntiGoogle is a decentralized search engine designed to filter out low-quality content. The current web is filled with search engine optimization spam and text generated by large language models. This project prioritizes human-written content from forums, personal blogs, and documentation. It runs as a distributed swarm using the Nostr protocol.

## Architecture

The system uses a hybrid search approach. It combines PostgreSQL full-text search using cover density ranking with semantic vector search via pgvector. Content quality is determined by several filters implemented in Python. A slop detector analyzes text structure and sentence variance to identify machine-generated text. It applies a penalty for specific phrases commonly used by language models. A set of Naive Bayes classifiers categorizes content into topics like technology or politics.

## Network Topology

We analyze the graph topology of the web to distinguish between organic communities and corporate hubs. The system calculates the clustering coefficient of domains. Sites that form meshes of mutual links are boosted. Sites that act as isolated stars are downranked.

## Decentralization

Crawling is coordinated over Nostr. Nodes use a Verifiable Random Function to determine which domains they are responsible for crawling. This prevents redundant work without requiring a central coordinator. When a node indexes a page, it broadcasts the result to the swarm.

## Personalization

Personalization happens on the client side using Locality Sensitive Hashing. The server does not track user queries. The browser re-ranks results based on the user's history.

## Usage

You can run the system using Docker Compose. The default configuration starts the database, Redis, API, and crawler workers. You need to initialize the database schema and seed the crawler queue.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec api python app/init_data.py
docker-compose exec crawler python -c "from app.crawler import seed_queue; import asyncio; asyncio.run(seed_queue())"

```

The API runs on port 8000. You can configure the system using environment variables for database connections and quality thresholds.
